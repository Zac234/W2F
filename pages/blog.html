        <p>Food. It is what we need. It is what we crave. there are some who believe food is the enemy and consume as
            little of it as possible, going on trend diets, shaming those who eat gloriously. well I say Nay! Eat what
            you want to there is no shame in it, there is no judgement. So EAT, Eat until you have had your fill!</p>
